# Medlang
This project introduces MedLang, a domain-specific language (DSL) designed to simplify the process of defining symptoms, medical rules, and diagnostic logic. MedLang enables users to write intuitive commands describing patient symptoms and conditional rules, which are interpreted by a Python-based rule engine to generate possible diagnoses.
